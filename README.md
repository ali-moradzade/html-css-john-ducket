# How to use?
you can clone the project, remove all my files:

```bash
$ cd src/me/

# this script clears content of all html files that i've wrote,
# but doesn't corrupt the structure of the project.
$ chmod 755 script.sh
$ ./script.sh
```
<br/>

then you can open the book in front of you and for each chapter (for example chapter 1) do the following:

```bash
$ cd src/

# use vscode to open the workspace
$ code book-code/chapter-01/ me/chapter-01/
```
and start using this workspace.
